# BYU Assesment
Here is the deliverable. I gave myself one workday (8 hours) extra to get this done and I was able to set up the API just fine and only had a couple issues with how Vue and Axios handle props passing and GET requests, respectively. To run my program do the following

1. Do git clone to get the repository.
2. Go to webservice and run `npm start`, this will start the server.
3. Open another instance of terminal, go to webapp and run `npm run dev` to start the application.
4. Go to http://localhost:8080 to view the front-end and http://localhost:8081 to view the back-end json responses.

Like I said I had a few hiccups with how Axios was handling my GET request and it took a bit of finagling to get it to work. After that I really wanted to get the results to show up in another page and spent a good 2-3 hours working on getting a new component to take care of that but I couldn't get it working in time. Defaulted to using the same component for display as well. Here is a screenshot:
